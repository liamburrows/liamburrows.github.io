## CMIT Summer School Lectures
I have delivered a handful of lectures for the CMIT undergraduate summer school for deep learning in mathematical imaging:
* [CMIT Lectures 2022](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2022): Topics include introduction to basic python, introduction to machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression) and introduction to deep learning with images (MNIST classification).
* [CMIT Lectures 2023](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2023): Topics include introduction to deep learning and convolutional neural networks. MNIST image classification, supervised segmentation on medical images, and an unsupervised denoising method based on a variational energy.

## Additional experience
During my PhD I was a teaching and marking assistant for a handful of applied maths modules, including numerical methods.
I also have experience co-supervising some final year project students at the Univerrsity of Bath in 2024.
