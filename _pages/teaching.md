## CMIT Summer School Lectures
I have delivered a handful of lectures for the CMIT undergraduate summer school for deep learning in mathematical imaging:
* [CMIT Lectures 2022](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2022): Topics include introduction to basic python, introduction to machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression) and introduction to deep learning with images (MNIST classification).
* CMIT Lectures [2023](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2023), [2024](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2024), [2025](https://github.com/liamburrows/CMIT_Lectures_2025): Topics include introduction to deep learning and convolutional neural networks. MNIST image classification, supervised segmentation on medical images, and an unsupervised denoising method based on a variational energy.

## Additional experience
Since 2024 I have co-supervised final year project students at the University of Bath: 2 in 2024, 1 in 2025, 2 in 2026.

During my PhD I was a teaching and marking assistant for a handful of applied maths modules, including numerical methods.
